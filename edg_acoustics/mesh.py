``edg_acoustics.mesh``
======================

The edg_acoustics mesh functions and classes provide functionality to process
and access mesh data generated by different mesh generators (e.g.,
`DOLFIN XML <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/dolfin-convert.1.html>`_ (``.xml``),
`Netgen <https://github.com/ngsolve/netgen>`_ (``.vol``, ``.vol.gz``),
`Gmsh <https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#File-formats>`_ (format versions 2.2, 4.0, and 4.1 ``.msh``)
courtesy of
the `meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`_ package.

Please note that the most-used mesh functions and classes in edg_acoustics are present in
the main :mod:`edg_acoustics` namespace rather than in :mod:`edg_acoustics.mesh`.  These are:
:class:`.Mesh`, and :func:`.some_function`.

Functions and classes present in :mod:`edg_acoustics.mesh` are listed below.

class Mesh:
    """Mesh data structure generated from common mesh file formats.

    Data structure containing mesh definition. Mesh data is obtained from
    data stored in common mesh file format by
    `Gmsh <https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#File-formats>`_ (format versions 2.2, 4.0, and 4.1 ``.msh``).
    Since mesh reading relies on meshio, other mesh generators can be made available in the future (e.g.,
    `DOLFIN XML <https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/dolfin-convert.1.html>`_ (``.xml``),
    `Netgen <https://github.com/ngsolve/netgen>`_ (``.vol``, ``.vol.gz``).

    :class:`.Mesh` defines the domain discretisation and is used to define
    the finite element approximation of the solution to the acoustic
    wave propagation.

    Args:
        filename (str): the file (pathlike) to read mesh data from. Supported format
            Gmsh (format versions 2.2, 4.0, and 4.1, .msh).
            Since mesh reading relies on meshio, the following formats can be made available in the future:
            Abaqus (.inp), ANSYS msh (.msh), AVS-UCD (.avs), CGNS (.cgns), DOLFIN XML (.xml), Exodus (.e, .exo),
            FLAC3D (.f3grid), H5M (.h5m), Kratos/MDPA (.mdpa), Medit (.mesh, .meshb), MED/Salome (.med),
            Nastran (bulk data, .bdf, .fem, .nas), Netgen (.vol, .vol.gz), Neuroglancer precomputed format,
            Gmsh (format versions 2.2, 4.0, and 4.1, .msh), OBJ (.obj), OFF (.off),
            PERMAS (.post, .post.gz, .dato, .dato.gz), PLY (.ply), STL (.stl), Tecplot .dat, TetGen .node/.ele,
            SVG (2D output only) (.svg), SU2 (.su2), UGRID (.ugrid), VTK (.vtk), VTU (.vtu), WKT (TIN) (.wkt),
            XDMF (.xdmf, .xmf).
        BC_labels (dict[str, int]): a dictionary containing the human readable label of each boundary condition and the
            associated lable number used in the mesh generator. BC_labels['my_label'] returns the label number of the
            label named 'my_label'. If BC_labels['my_label'] is not present in the mesh, an error is raised. If a label
            is present in the mesh but not in BC_labels, an error is raised.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If BC_labels['my_label'] is not present in the mesh, an error is raised. If a label
            is present in the mesh but not in BC_labels, an error is raised.

    Attributes:
        N_vertices (int): The number of vertices that make up the mesh.
        N_tets (int): The number of tetrahedra that make up the mesh (number of elements).
        N_BC_triangles (dict[str, int]): the number of triangles on the boundary of the domain associated to each
            boundary label in self.BC_labels. For example self.N_BC_triangles['my_label'] returns the number of boundary
            triangles associated to lable 'my_label'. 'my_label' must be a key of self.BC_labels.
        vertices (numpy.ndarray): An (self.N_vertices x M) array containing the M coordinates of the self.N_vertices vertices that make up
            the mesh. M specifies the geometric dimension of the mesh, such that the mesh describes an M-dimensional
            domain.
        tets (numpy.ndarray): An (self.N_tets x 4) array containing the 4 indices of the vertices of the self.N_tets
               tetrahedra that make up the mesh.
        BC_triangles (dict[str, numpy.ndarray]):
