## Description

DG_RoomAcoustics is an open-source software package designed for the simulation of room acoustics using the time-domain wave-based method. This software implements the nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for spatial discretization of the linear acoustic equations, integrated over time with high-order schemes such as explicit ADER (Arbitrary high-order DERivative) integration. DG_RoomAcoustics excels in scenarios where traditional geometrical acoustics tools fall short, providing superior accuracy in capturing complex wave phenomena such as diffraction, scattering, and modal effects. Following the principles of object-oriented programming paradigm, the software is designed with a focus on ease of use and flexibility, allowing researchers and engineers to simulate a wide range of room acoustics problems with high accuracy and computational efficiency.
