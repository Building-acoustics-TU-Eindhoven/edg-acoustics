# Next steps

## Put the generated files under version control

Once your Python package is created, put it under [version
control](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/#/best_practices/version_control) using
[git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

```shell
cd edg-acoustics
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/EDG-Acoustics/edg-acoustics
```

## Push the initial commit to a new repo on GitHub

Go to
[https://github.com/organizations/EDG-Acoustics/repositories/new](https://github.com/organizations/EDG-Acoustics/repositories/new)
and create a new repository named `edg-acoustics` as an empty repository, then push your commits to GitHub:

```shell
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

## Check automatically generated issues

A short while after you push your commits to GitHub for the first time, a few issues outlining next steps will added
automatically ([here](https://github.com/EDG-Acoustics/edg-acoustics/issues?q=author%3Aapp%2Fgithub-actions)). Resolve them to complete the
setup of your repository.
